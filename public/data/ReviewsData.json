    "reviewText": "Painting inside my home and removing popcorn ceiling was what I needed for many years.   Elty and her husband made this happen for me and I couldn't be happier.   They help in every way during the process of selecting and purchasing all that is needed for the job.   They go above and beyond what is expected and do a fabulous job.  Very professional paint job and excellent cleanup during and after each finished area.  Very happy with the updates they made for me and I appreciate their service and would recommend them anytime."

    "reviewText": "Elty's did a phenomenal job on multiple closets that were full of drawers and shelves lots of built ins.  The price was very fair and the work was perfect and the amount of time it took was super short.  Top notch paint was used.  They also took wallpaper glue off a bathroom walls for me that was super thick and I had given in myself.  I really thought there was no hope.  In less than 2 hours it was gone and all cleaned up.  I am so grateful to Elty her husband and crew.  Great job and I highly recommend and will definitely be using them again!"

    "reviewText": "I hired Elty's to remove popcorn ceilings and paint my living room, hallway, and foyer for a split level house. The crew did a fantastic job and my living area looks polished and new. I appreciated that they started early each morning and were able to complete the job in less than a week and a half. The pricing was competitive and Elty communicated with me regularly on updates. I'm so glad I was able to find a quality and reliable painting company. Thank you!"

They had to install new hardware and it looks great. The job took two days and they cleaned after each day. They were on time and had all their supplies with them. Their pricing was very affordable. I would absolutely hire them again. Thank you Elty, I love my new vanities."
