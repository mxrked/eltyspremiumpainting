    "reviewText": "Painting inside my home and removing popcorn ceiling was what I needed for many years.   Elty and her husband made this happen for me and I couldn't be happier.   They help in every way during the process of selecting and purchasing all that is needed for the job.   They go above and beyond what is expected and do a fabulous job.  Very professional paint job and excellent cleanup during and after each finished area.  Very happy with the updates they made for me and I appreciate their service and would recommend them anytime."

    "reviewText": "Elty's did a phenomenal job on multiple closets that were full of drawers and shelves lots of built ins.  The price was very fair and the work was perfect and the amount of time it took was super short.  Top notch paint was used.  They also took wallpaper glue off a bathroom walls for me that was super thick and I had given in myself.  I really thought there was no hope.  In less than 2 hours it was gone and all cleaned up.  I am so grateful to Elty her husband and crew.  Great job and I highly recommend and will definitely be using them again!"
